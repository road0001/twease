v2.0 Beta 2 (With AS3!) (04/02/08)

  New:
    -ActionScript 3.0 Ported! Same syntax allows you to use the same tweens across all projects (un-optimized)
    -Tween startup performance boost eliminates staggered starting of simultaneous tweens
    -Twease core now has integrated mulit-point bezier tweening for any property
    -Twease.tween() rate property allows you to tween at a constant rate instead of a specific duration of time
    -Twease.tween() progress parameter allows you to start a tween at any point in its life 0(start) - 1(finished)
    -Extend methods and automation to extend core Twease methods and tweenable properties
    -Colors, Extras, and Texts classes that use new Extend class
    -Texts class lets you tween Object-strings (var mytext:Object = {text:"A"}) based on a given characterset
    -Colors class lets you tween color transformation objects such as tint, brightness and contrast
    -Twease.render() method allows manual rendering of non-engine managed tween objects
    -Twease.tween() 2nd parameter for sequence and single tween target-overrides 
    -Twease.tween() 3rd parameter for non-managed tween, true makes a new object, passing an object uses that
    -Tween object has easeposition property that returns the position of a tween on an ease path (0-1)
    -Stack option in tween call to enable stacking on a per-tween basis
    -Cycles support for function-only calls including delays
    -Colors: static color functions: 'setColor', 'getColorObject'
    -Twease: baseprops array and compareInObject method
    
  Changes:
    -Update loop uses render's return to delete tweens
    -Delay adds 1/1000 second to trigger delay progress check
    -Twease update loop now calls the render() method on activetweens
    -Tween method returns full object of tween, not array
    -In render function for beziers and rate
    -Tween check for baseprops now using compareInObject function
    -Extend class redone and actually functional
    -Twease.tween to implement extended properties
    -getTweens method is now in Extras class
    
  Removed:
    -Undefined checks in Twease.update loop (performance boost?)
    -Twease.extendedprops (now is dynamically added)
    
  Fixes:
    -[RC] Subtweens were not updating starttime on setActive, thus causing them to not resume correctly
    -Bug (introduced with update change?) where funcs wouldn't remove themselves because of 0 cycles
    -When stacking props was false, the propcount would never reach 0, resulting in failed GC
    

v1.1 (09/10/07)

	New:
		-Tweening of full arrays with the array:[x, y, z] prop
		-Tweening of a specific index value from an array (array[i]) with the index[i, value] prop
		-Twease core is now less than 200 lines of code, yet faster with more features!
		-Twease.stacking allows disabling of tween stacking
		-Twease.register() for extending Twease
		-Extend class (beta) (only used for getTweens() for now)
		-registering Easing allows you to use strings for easesing values - ease:'easeOutBounce'
		-Easing class from the Fuse Kit Penner Easing Class
		-extra1 and extra2 for extra easing args
		-extendedprops and extensions twease variables
	
	Changes:
		-misc code formating changes
		-getTweens() now in the Extend class
		-tween() internal function is shorter, rearranged a bit, and slightly faster
		-moved getTimer() call in update out of the loops
	
	Removed:
		-tween() active check for func tweens
	
	Fixes:
		-startpos in tween() to ftv possible bug
		-getTweens() active if/else
		-delay for func only tweens


v1.01 (07/27/07)
	Fixes:
		-delay and cycle issue
		-garbage collection bug killing engine


v1.0 (07/07/07)
	Initial Release
