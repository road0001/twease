A light, powerful, and open source tweening engine and sequencer for AS2 and AS3.

Note: this package has been succeeded by the Desuade Motion Package - http://desuade.com/dmp

The release of Twease 2.0 marks the most significant update to one of the most innovative tweening packages available. Available in both AS2 and AS3 with the same syntax, Twease 2 is now feature-complete and ready to be used everywhere. I encourage you to download Twease now and play around with it. I'm sure you'll find it's feature-rich and intuitive syntax a pleasure to use in all of your projects - not to mention it's trademark filesize that will save you so much.
